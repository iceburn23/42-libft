"Libft – your own first library" / individual project at Ecole 42

“Libft – your own first library” is an individual project at 42, it is the second one i have worked on after the “Piscine Reloaded one”.

The aim of this project is to code a C library regrouping usual functions that we’ll be allowed to use in all our other projects. At 42 we are not allowed to use standard C library function, we can use only function we coded ourself. So the longer term goal of this library is to grow with our own function.

For this library there are only 3 standard library function allowed are write() from <unistd.h>, malloc() and free() from <stdlib.h>. We are allowed also to use <string.h> for accessing size_t and NULL.
